# Housing_DataCleaning_SQL

This project will show you some basic methods to clean housing data with SQL, which include 6 blocks:


 1. Change and save the datatype of SaleDate
 2. Check the NULL values of PropertyAddress and populate them
 3. Seperate the PropertyAddress into 2 columns: address, city and save them as new coloumns
 4. Seperate the OwnerAddress into 3 columns: address, city, STATE and save them as well
 5. Clean the SoldAsVacant, unify the Yes and Y as Yes (No and N as No) 
 6. Check the duplicated rows using CTE, and remove them.
